Genbank-Downloaders
===================

A series of small Bio-Python scripts for downloading sequence data off NCBI's Genbank.

Here is a short description of each script:

* **GetCDS.py** - Takes a list of Genbank accessions and downloads the coding sequences for each accession.
* **GetNucleotide.py** - Takes a list of Genbank accessions and downloads a nucleotide sequence for each accession.
* **Get16s.py** - Takes a list of Genbank accessions and downloads a 16S gene for each accession. 
* **GetOrganism.py** - Finds the taxa of each accession number in given list.
